# Cars [{ðŸš—}] with Express, Node.js and Mongo DB  

A school exercise where I set up a back-end server and connected it to a MongoDB database.   
With the help of Mockaroo, I created a list of 500 mock objects.   
To add the mock data to the database, I used Postman to do a POST request to a route in the server.  
During this exercise, I learned more about working with MongoDB and how to create queries to filter results based on specific criteria. 

#### Technologies used:
